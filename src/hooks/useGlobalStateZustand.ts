/** Use Zustans When your application is medium to large,
 *  You want high performance and minimal setup and You donâ€™t need complex middleware or advanced async logic. */
// Strengths: Minimal Configuration, High Performance, No Provider Required.
// Weaknesses: Not Ideal for Very Large Applications.

/* Another Way*/
// Use Context API + useReducer when your App small or medium, Manament some simple State
// And You want to stick with native React APIs and avoid installing external libraries.

/* Use Redux */
// Your application is large or enterprise-level.
// You need to manage complex state logic and handle side effects.
//You need advanced middleware and powerful DevTools for debugging.
